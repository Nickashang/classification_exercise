# Classification of Bulk Material by Structure Borne Sound

This repository contains an example for multiclass classification as introduction to machine learning on audio signals. Different bulk materials create characteristic structure borne sounds when rolling/slipping down a ramp. Audio recordings from different types of screws and bolts rolling down an aluminium ramp have been conducted. A deep neural network (DNN) is trained and evaluated for the classification of the type of bulk metarial rolling down the ramp.


## Getting Started
